Updating from blocks defined with JavaScript to blocks defined with JSON: 

1. Replace comments that look like this:
```
  /**
   * Block to turn right.
   * @this Blockly.Block
   */
```

with their single-line equivalents:
`// Block to turn right.`

with the following regexes in vscode find and replace (or however you like using regexes)
Find: `\/\*\*\n *\*( Block.*)\n.*\n *\*\/`
Replace: `//$1`

Note: Multiline doc comments will need to be replaced manually.


2. Swap the comment and the `Blockly.Blocks['blockname'] = {` lines with the following regexes:
Find: `(Blockly.Blocks\['.*'\] = \{\n)((?: *\/\/.*\n)+)`
Replace: `$2$1`

3. Remove `init: function () {this.jsonInit()}` wrapper with the following regexes:

Find: `init: function\(\) \{\n *this\.jsonInit\(([^\)]*)\);\n *\}`
Replace: `$1`

Note that this leaves it in a bad state.

4. Move block name into block definition with the following regexes:

Find: `Blockly\.Blocks\[(.*)\] = \{\n *\{([^;]*\n)*\};`
Replace: `{\n  'type': $1,$2,`

5. At the top of the file, add 

```
import * as Blockly from 'blockly/core';

export const blocks = Blockly.common.createBlockDefinitionsFromJsonArray([
```

6. At the bottom of the file add
```
]);
```

7. Run a formatter or something.
